## Overview

Hello! Toobers is a simon-esque toy used for teaching in [MIT's 2.00b Toy Product Design](https://web.mit.edu/2.00b/www) Class. The goal of this project is to quickly get started and comfortable with making things and getting a quick overview of how one might put a toy together. The early parts are focused on electronics and prototyping, followed by some soldering and CAD work for the housing.

We'll be updating this for 2023 shortly.
